# Particle Identification with Machine Learning

The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is an important subdetector of the
CMS experiment in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This work aims the
identification of electrons, photons and pions, by observing the signature
of these particles in the barrel section of the ECAL. We use a computer
vision approach to deal with the energy distributions, specifically,
we solve a supervised classification problem with three target classes.
Our classification model is based upon one of the most effective machine
learning algorithms up to date: the artificial neural networks with
convolutional layers.
