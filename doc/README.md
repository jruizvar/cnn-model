# Particle Identification with Machine Learning

The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is an important subdetector in the
CMS experiment at CERN. This work aims the identification of electrons,
photons and pions, by observing the signature of these particles in the
barrel section of the ECAL. We use a computer vision approach to deal with
the energy distributions, specifically, we solve a supervised classification
problem with three target classes. Our classification model is based upon
one of the most effective Machine Learning algorithms up to date:
Artificial Neural Networks with convolutional layers.
