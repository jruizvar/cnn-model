# Particle Identification with Machine Learning

The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is an important subdetector of the
CMS experiment at the CERN's Large Hadron Collider. This work aims the
identification of electrons, photons and pions, by observing the signatures
of these particles in the ECAL barrel. We use a computer vision approach to
deal with the energy distributions, specifically, we solve a supervised
classification problem with three target classes. Our classification model
is based upon one of the most effective machine learning algorithms, which are
the artificial neural networks with convolutional layers.
